		<p>Located on the island of Bohol in the Philippines, the Chocolate Hills are a slight mystery to locals and visitors alike. Sometimes called the "Eighth Wonder of the World," the Chocolate Hills are the Philippines' third National Geological Monument, established in 1988, and even appear on Bohol's local flag. The attraction is exactly what it sounds like: rounded hills located at the center of the tiny island that go brown in color during the dry season so they end up looking like giant chocolate truffles. </p>

<h1 style="font-family: Garamond;" id="name_of_country" align="center"> History </h1>
<br>
	<p align="center">The Philippines takes its name from Philip II, who was king of Spain during the Spanish colonization of the islands in the 16th century. Because it was under Spanish rule for 333 years and under U.S. tutelage for a further 48 years, the Philippines has many cultural affinities with the West. It is, for example, the second most-populous Asian country (following India) with English as an official language and one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia (the other being East Timor). Despite the prominence of such Anglo-European cultural characteristics, the peoples of the Philippines are Asian in consciousness and aspiration. The country was wracked by political turmoil in the last quarter of the 20th century. After enduring more than a decade of authoritarian rule under Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, the broadly popular People Power movement in 1986 led a bloodless uprising against the regime. The confrontation resulted not only in the ouster and exile of Marcos but also in the restoration of democratic government to the Philippines. Contemporary Filipinos continue to grapple with a society that is replete with paradoxes, perhaps the most obvious being the presence of extreme wealth alongside tremendous poverty. Rich in resources, the Philippines has the potential to build a strong industrial economy, but the country remains largely agricultural. Especially toward the end of the 20th century, rapid industrial expansion was spurred by a high degree of domestic and foreign investment. That growth, however, simultaneously contributed to severe degradation of the environment. The Philippines also emerged as a regional leader in education during the late 20th century, with a well-established public school and university system, and by the early 21st century the country had one of the highest literacy rates in Asia.</p>

		<td width="400"><p>El Nido in Palawan is most famous for its paradise-like islands and lagoons, but a 45-minute ride from its main town takes you to another idyllic destination: Nacpan Beach. Island hopping escapades in El Nido, including a visit to El Nido Big Lagoon and other top Palawan beaches should not be missed. But after a jam-packed day of visiting coves, white-sand beaches in El Nido, limestone cliffs, and other El Nido Palawan tourist spots, a trip to relaxing Nacpan Beach is highly recommended. </p></td>
		<td width="400"><p>Tubbataha Reef is regarded as one of the top diving spots in the Philippines, and, perhaps, the world. Located at the heart of the Sulu Sea, it is considered a center of marine biodiversity and a haven not just for divers but marine conservationists as well. The only way to get to this marine sanctuary is through a liveaboard vessel from Puerto Princesa, Palawan. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was nominated as part of the “New Seven Wonders of the Natural World.” </p></td>
		<td width="400"><p>Locals and foreign visitors from Manila often take a quick escape from the megacity and make their way south to Tagaytay, a relaxing town famous for its cool weather, magnificent views, and many tourist spots. It's popular for being one of the best kid-friendly places near Manila.  The volcano sits on an island within a lake within an island. Head to Tagaytay restaurants, Tagaytay cafes, or Tagaytay hotels with a view of Taal. While in Taghttps://guidetothephilippines.ph/articles/ultimate-guides/mayon-volcano-guide-albay-bicolaytay and Batangas, heat up your trip with a delectable bowl of Bulalo, a clear broth with beef shanks, bone marrow, and corn.
